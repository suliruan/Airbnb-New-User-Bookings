# Airbnb-New-User-Bookings

For the capstone project, we decided to use Airbnb dataset from kaggle to predict where new users will book their first travel destination based on the their booking behaviors and demographic information. We performed data cleaning, data processing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning on the project.
 
Goals:

1.If we have $500,000 marketing campaign budget on international market and domestic market (USA), what is your marketing campaign strategy recommendation based on your insights?

2.Use train dataset to train a model in order to forecast the nest country destination by using test dataset.
